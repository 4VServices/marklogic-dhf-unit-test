# Data Hub with Unit Tests

This repo shows how to set up marklogic-unit-test to work with different versions of MarkLogic's Data Hub framework.
See the custom tasks defined in build.gradle.

All of the example projects here use `admin`/`admin` as the username and password. You should not do this on any shared
system, but you knew that already.
